# Project Plan

This document tracks the development of the HyperCLOVAX chatbot example.

## 1. Setup Repository
* Added minimal `requirements.txt`.
* Created CLI and GUI in `main.py`.
* Ensured model loads in `float32`.

## 2. Added Features
* Implemented CLI conversation with optional image input.
* Implemented Tkinter GUI resembling WhatsApp style.
* Added basic unit test for CLI parser.
* Wrote README with usage instructions.

## 3. Maintenance
* Consolidated documentation into `project_plan.md` and deleted the old
  `project_file.md` to avoid merge conflicts.
